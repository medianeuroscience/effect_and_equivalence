Once the custom dialog file is downloaded, either double-click on the file and select “Install” in the dialog window that appears or, from within SPSS, go to “Utilities – Custom Dialog – Install Custom Dialog…” and select the file from the file browser window. This will install the downloaded custom dialog into SPSS. Installation requires administrative access to your computer. You may have to open SPSS as administrator as well. You can find instructions how to do this here. It is necessary to close and re-start SPSS for the new menus to appear in SPSS under “Analyze-Compare Means” and “Analyze-Correlate”.
